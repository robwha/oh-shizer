Google Analytics Error Tracking
--------------------------------

For the code in the index.html to work you'll need to firstly set up a Google Analytics (GA) account and have it recording data. This will help with troubleshooting any errors.

Include the error code snippet, remeber add the _setAccount code supplied when you registered GA. You cgit an use the javascript method of capturing the page status code the I put in the page tittle, or return the statusCode serverside and test against the error codes you'd like to capture. 

When setting the _trackPageview variable between the URL and status code a "#" has been included. This is to make it easier to filter for errors.

Once you start to successfully record errors log into GA and navigate to the "Real-time BETA" page. 
	* Select the "Content" view
	* Enter "#404" (or which ever status code your searching) in the filter field and submit.
	
This will display just the occurances of "#404" and give you live data. Can test by forcing a 404 error the site. Within seconds this will appear in the filtered real time view.

Can also extend this further by adding specific GA events each time something happens. Could be a build number or something to associate errors to releases over time.
